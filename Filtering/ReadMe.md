## Key points
* Multiple data points are more accurate than one data point, so throw nothing away no matter how inaccurate it is.
* Always choose a number part way between two data points to create a more accurate estimate.
* Predict the next measurement and rate of change based on the current estimate and how much we think it will change.
* The new estimate is then chosen as part way between the prediction and next measurement scaled by how accurate each is.
